Put on my jeans, my favorite shirt
Pull up my boots and hit the dirt
Finally doin' somethin' I've dreamed of for years
Don't know quite what to expect
A little scared, but what the heck
My desire is always greater than my fear
Big dreams and faded jeans
Fit together like a team
Always busting at the seams
Big dreams and faded jeans
Just my ole guitar and me
Out to find my destiny
Nashville is the place to be
For big dreams and faded jeans
Put out my thumb and wish for luck
To hitch a car, a semi-truck
Sooner or later one will catch me in their beams
Then I'll be on my way at last
Find a future, lose a past
Waiting silent as the passion in me screams
Big dreams and faded jeans
Fit together like a team
Always busting at the seams
Big dreams and faded jeans
May the stars that fill my eyes
Guide my path and be my light
And may God provide the means
To accomplish my big dreams, my big dreams
Big dreams and faded jeans
Fit together like a team
Always busting at the seams
Big dreams and faded jeans
Like the song "Bobby McGee" (freedom's just another word)
I'm just longin' to be free (to be free)
Take me where I want to be
Big dreams and faded jeans
And there are many just like me
With big dreams and faded jeans
Mmh-mm-mm-mm
Mmh-mm-mm-mm
Big dreams, big dreams and faded jeans
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just longing to be free
Take me where I want to be
Big dreams and faded jeans
